This is a place for me to learn langchain and insomnia api development.
My inital goal is to design an API that can take an image and convert the
information to a json format.

The API should be simple. Users can send an image with a specified JSONformat and 
will recieve a JSON with the data from the image.

To set up a JSONformat the users can submit a name and an example JSON or a premade JSONformat and 
will recieve a conformation.

Users can also submit an image or example JSON to recieve a premade JSONformat.

The question is wether I want to have a db storing formats or just have it be part of the request.
For now we will do part of the request but have it easy to update latter.
